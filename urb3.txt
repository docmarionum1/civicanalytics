In post World War II America the suburbs were growing, and highways were being built to support that growth.  Many cities had highways build right through their downtowns, dividing existing neighborhoods, preventing mobility for those without cars and leading to very distinct socioeconomic conditions on the different sides of the highways.  

Dallas was no exception, constructing four highways which encircled downtown.  Now, with the highways in disrepair, something has to be done about them.  The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is working on a project called CityMAP (Dallas City Center Master Assessment Process) to assess various plans for the highways and downtown Dallas.  But it's not just a repair plan - instead they are approaching it with broad goals in mind such as: Include Multi-modal Solutions, Reconnect Urban Form, Connect Neighborhoods, Establish Pedestrian Connections and Promote Quality of Life.  And among the options being considered is tearing down one of those highways, I-345, which currently divides downtown with East Dallas.  This would require the rest of highway infrastructure to handle the 160,000 vehicles that currently use I-345 each day.  But would also open up about 200 acres of developable area to the booming downtown.   

Dallas isn't alone in looking at the possibility of removing downtown highways.  Cities such as New York with the West Side Highway and Boston with the Big Dig have already removed or repurposed their highways, and other cities such as Toronto and Houston are considering similar plans.
