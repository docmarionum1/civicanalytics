On Roosevelt Island, instead of a fleet of garbage trucks making the rounds to pick up trash, trash is collected via a series of tubes.  Not the sort of tubes that compose the internet, but a pneumatic tube system called AVACS (Automated vacuum waste collection system).  It's not new technology - in fact quite the opposite.  The system was installed in 1976 and is largely unchanged from how it originally was.  When residents drop waste into a trash chute it falls through a trap door into a large tube where it sits.  Then about five times a day operators flip a switch to turn vacuums on and suck all of the trash out of the tubes.  There are no computers involved, just the old analog switches and pressure dials.  The system can't handle any sort of trash, such as oversized items, so some still needs to be manually delivered to the plant.

The AVACS system clearly never caught on in a big way.  The Roosevelt Island system is still the only residential system in the United States and one of the biggest in the world.  Another large system in The US is in Disney World.  Envac, a company that creates these systems claims to have about 1000 installations across the world.  

There are several benefits to these systems - ease of collection, preventing overflowing cans and removing the need to have garbage sitting around on curbsides for pick up.  It's this last one that is attracting the developers for Hudson Yards to the system saying "We donâ€™t want people enjoying the art or shopping beside huge piles of garbage,"
